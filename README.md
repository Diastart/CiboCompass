# CiboCompass
A University Project for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). CiboCompass is a cross-platform mobile app developed with Expo Go for the course Human-Computer Interaction. The project explores HCI principles through iterative design, user research, and testing—including surveys (Google Forms), prototyping (Figma), and usability evaluations.

Our app helps international students in Italy understand restaurant menus. After selecting their nationality, users can search dishes to see ingredients, calories, burn-off steps, and a global “like” percentage. They can also give feedback, helping tailor recommendations for others from similar backgrounds.
